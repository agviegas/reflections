Imagine you’re ten years old again. Your biggest worry is that your sandwich doesn’t touch the banana inside your backpack. And one fine day, when you open the mailbox, there’s a letter sealed with wax addressed to you. It comes with good news and bad news.

The good news is that **Hogwarts is real**, and it wants you as a student. Yes, you. Years of magic await you in an impossible castle, with hallways that change places and forests brimming with endless secrets.

The bad news is… well, wands are illegal. Completely forbidden, especially for kids. They’re considered far too dangerous. And honestly, maybe they have a point: an entire school full of teenagers with access to weapons capable of vaporizing half a classroom? But don’t worry, they say. Even without a wand, you’re going to learn magic anyway.

Your first day of class arrives. They sit you down, hand you a blank parchment, and the teacher begins reciting spells you can’t see, can’t use, can’t even imagine. But he insists they’re fundamental, that they “furnish the mind,” and—most importantly—that they’re on the exam. So you take notes.

The years go by. And eventually, the magic becomes so theoretical, so distant from anything you can touch, that it stops being magic at all. It’s just noise—formulas you memorize without understanding. There’s always that one classmate who actually loves this stuff, the premium geek who would solve integrals at the beach, but you’re not them.

My story with math went the same way. Even though I studied science, it was the subject that inspired me the least. I couldn’t see anything. I couldn’t understand anything. And worst of all: it wasn’t useful for anything in front of me. But life, which sometimes has a pretty twisted sense of humor, led me to 3D programming. And that’s where I found the magic.

Because it turns out vectors, matrices, and quaternions stopped being mysterious words and became my tools for building mountains, moving lights, and creating worlds. It felt like I’d been handed my first wand. And a good one, too—dragon-core, none of that second-hand stuff.

I use math every day. I like it the same way a carpenter likes their hammer. I’m not passionate about it, but it lets me create things I am passionate about.

So maybe the problem isn’t that math is boring. Maybe it’s that we teach it as if Hogwarts were a wandless academy. All theory, no magic. And of course, no one falls in love that way.

In 2025, with calculators, computers, and graphic engines that can build you a 3D forest while you have a snack, maybe it no longer makes sense to ask students to do fifty matrix multiplications by hand. Maybe it’s more interesting for them to make a video game, a simulation, or a neural network. Something that shines, that moves, that matters to them. Call me crazy, but I’m all for teaching with wands.
