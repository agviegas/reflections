Imagine being ten again. Your biggest worry is that your sandwich doesn't end up mashed against the banana in your backpack. Then one day, you open the mailbox and there it is: a wax-sealed letter with your name on it. Good news and bad news.

Good news first: **Hogwarts is real**, and they want you. Yes, you. Years of magic in an impossible castle, moving hallways and forests full of secrets.

Bad news: **wands are banned**. Completely. Especially for kids. Too dangerous, they say. And honestly, fair enough. A building full of teenagers with the power to blow a hole through a classroom? But don't worry, they say, **you'll learn magic anyway**.

So day one arrives. They sit you down, hand you a blank sheet, and the professor starts mumbling spells you can't see, can't use, can't even visualize. But they're _important_, they _build character_, and, naturally, _they're on the test_. So you take notes dutifully.

Years go by. And the magic fades into pure abstraction. It's not magic anymore; it's noise. Formulas without meaning. There's always that one kid who genuinely loves this stuff (the kind who'd happily solve equations on vacation). But that kid isn't you.

That was my relationship with math. I studied science, but math was the class I dreaded most. Nothing clicked. Nothing felt real. Nothing mattered. And then life, with its usual sense of irony, shoved me straight into 3D programming. And suddenly there was the magic.

Vectors, matrices, quaternions… all the stuff that once felt like dark incantations turned into actual tools. Tools to build mountains, move lights, create worlds. It was like someone finally handed me a wand worthy of a dragon-core. No toy store knockoff.

I use math every day now. I don't adore it any more than a carpenter adores a hammer. But like a hammer, it lets me build the things I do love.

So maybe math isn't the problem. Maybe the problem is we teach it like Hogwarts with no wands. All theory. No magic. And then we're shocked that no one falls in love with it.

It's 2025. Calculators, computers, graphics engines—they can conjure a 3D forest before you finish your snack. Maybe forcing students to grind through fifty matrix multiplications by hand isn't the badge of honor we pretend it is. Maybe it's more useful—and more inspiring—to have them build a game, a simulation, a neural network. Something alive. Something that matters.

Call me crazy, but I'm all in on teaching with wands.
