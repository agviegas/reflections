# Welcome

This is a simple, minimalistic platform for writing and sharing articles.

## Features

- Clean, monochrome design
- Markdown support for easy writing
- Simple navigation
- No complex dependencies

## Getting Started

To add a new article:

1. Create a new markdown file in the `articles` folder (e.g., `my-article.md`)
2. Add an entry to `articles/index.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": "my-article",
    "title": "My Article Title",
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "excerpt": "A brief description of the article"
}
```

The `id` should match the filename (without the `.md` extension).

## Writing

You can use standard markdown syntax:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- Lists
- Headers
- Links
- And more!

Happy writing!
